# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## Structure

The `src` directory contains the solutions for each day. Each day has its own directory, named `day-XX`, where `XX` is the day of the challenge. Each day is generated by `scripts/generateADay.js` script that takes a day input and creates bootstrap day.

## How to use

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run tests
```bash
#for all tests
pnpm test

#for single test
pnpm test -- day-01
```

Create a new day
```bash
pnpm day 26
```

## Built With

- [@swc/jest](https://github.com/swc-project/jest) - Super-fast JavaScript testing framework.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
